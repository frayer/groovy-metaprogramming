Groovy Metaprogramming
======================

About
-----

This is a project with specifications to show off features of Groovy
Metaprogramming.  Your job is to write to code to get them to pass.

The master branch contains all the specifications with no supporting
implementing code.  The working solution is contained in the tag "solution-v1".

Running
-------
The project can be built and the tests ran with Gradle using the following
command at the root of the project:

    gradle test

Or, you can use the daemon feature of Gradle which will make subsequent runs
faster:

    gradle --daemon test
